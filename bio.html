  <p>My name is Daniel Griffith (DOB: 24/04/1999).<br/><br/> I am an aspiring software engineer currently studying at the University of Guyana.<br/><br/>
     My main career focus is on artificial intelligence.<br/><br/>
     I strongly believe it will be a central component in the development of way of life in the future.<br/><br/>
     I am very much into sports. I enjoy playing and watching football and basketball<br/> and have represented St. Stanislaus College in both at the secondary school level.<br/>
     The teams I support are Manchester United and Cleveland Cavaliers.<br/><br/>
     Over the years, I have learnt that success only comes with hard work,<br/>
     and in following this notion, I am willing to undertake <br/> any task that will aid in the attainment of career goals.<br/><br/>
